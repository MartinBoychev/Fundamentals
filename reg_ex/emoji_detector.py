# Your task is to write a program that extracts emojis from a text and find the threshold based on the input. You
# have to get your cool threshold. It is obtained by multiplying all the digits found in the input.  The cool
# threshold could be a huge number, so be mindful. An emoji is valid when: It is surrounded by 2 characters,
# either "::" or "**" It is at least 3 characters long (without the surrounding symbols) It starts with a capital
# letter Continues with lowercase letters only Examples of valid emojis: ::Joy::, **Banana**, ::Wink:: Examples of
# invalid emojis: ::Joy**, ::fox:es:, **Monk3ys**, :Snak::Es:: You need to count all valid emojis in the text and
# calculate their coolness. The coolness of the emoji is determined by summing all the ASCII values of all letters in
# the emoji. Examples: ::Joy:: - 306, **Banana** - 577, ::Wink:: - 409 You need to print the result of the cool
# threshold and, after that to take all emojis out of the text, count them and print only the cool ones on the
# console. Input On the single input, you will receive a piece of string. Output On the first line of the output,
# print the obtained Cool threshold in the format: "Cool threshold: {coolThresholdSum}" On the following line,
# print the count of all emojis found in the text in format: "{countOfAllEmojis} emojis found in the text. The cool
# ones are: {cool emoji 1} {cool emoji 2} â€¦ {cool emoji N}"

import re

text = input()

digits = re.findall(r'\d', text)
coolThresholdSum = 1
for digit in digits:
    coolThresholdSum *= int(digit)
print(f"Cool threshold: {coolThresholdSum}")

emojis = re.findall(r'(::|\*\*)([A-Z][a-z]{2,})\1', text)
coolEmojis = []
for emoji in emojis:
    coolness = sum(ord(char) for char in emoji[1])
    if coolness > coolThresholdSum:
        coolEmojis.append(emoji[0] + emoji[1] + emoji[0])

print(f"{len(emojis)} emojis found in the text. The cool ones are:")
for emoji in coolEmojis:
    print(emoji)
