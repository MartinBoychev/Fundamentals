# Anonymous has created a hyper cyber virus, which steals data from the CIA. The virus is known for its innovative
# and unbelievablyÂ clever merging and dividing data into partitions. As the lead security developer in the CIA,
# you have been tasked to analyze the software of the virus and observe its actions on the data. You will receive a
# single input line containing strings, separated by spaces. The strings may contain any ASCII character except
# whitespace. Then you will begin receiving commands in one of the following formats: merge {startIndex} {endIndex}
# divide {index} {partitions} Every time you receive the merge command, you must merge all elements from the
# startIndex to the endIndex. In other words, you should concatenate them. Example: {abc, def, ghi} -> merge 0 1 -> {
# abcdef, ghi} If any of the given indexes is out of the array, you must take only the range that is inside the array
# and merge it. Every time you receive the divide command, you must divide the element at the given index into
# several small substrings with equal length. The count of the substrings should be equal to the given partitions.
# Example: {abcdef, ghi, jkl} -> divide 0 3 -> {ab, cd, ef, ghi, jkl} If the string cannot be exactly divided into
# the given partitions, make all partitions except the last with equal lengths and make the last one - the longest.
# Example: {abcd, efgh, ijkl} -> divide 0 3 -> {a, b, cd, efgh, ijkl} The input ends when you receive the command
# "3:1". At that point, you must print the resulting elements, joined by a space. Input The first input line will
# contain the array of data. On the next several input lines, you will receive commands in the format specified
# above. The input ends when you receive the command "3:1". Output As output, you must print a single line containing
# the elements of the array, joined by a space.
