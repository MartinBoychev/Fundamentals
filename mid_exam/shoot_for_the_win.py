# Write a program that helps you keep track of your shot targets. You will receive a sequence with integers,
# separated by a single space, representing targets and their value. Afterward, you will be receiving indices until
# the "End" command is given, and you need to print the targets and the count of shot targets. Every time you receive
# an index, you need to shoot the target on that index, if it is possible. Every time you shoot a target,
# its value becomes -1, and it is considered shot. Along with that, you also need to: Reduce all the other targets,
# which have greater values than your current target, with its value. Increase all the other targets, which have less
# than or equal value to the shot target, with its value. Keep in mind that you can't shoot a target,
# which is already shot. You also can't increase or reduce a target, which is considered shot. When you receive the
# "End" command, print the targets in their current state and the count of shot targets in the following format:
# "Shot targets: {count} -> {target1} {target2}â€¦ {targetn}"
