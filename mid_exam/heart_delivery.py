# Valentine's day is coming, and Cupid has minimal time to spread some love across the neighborhood. Help him with
# his mission! You will receive a string with even integers, separated by a "@" - this is our neighborhood. After
# that, a series of Jump commands will follow until you receive "Love!". Every house in the neighborhood needs a
# certain number of hearts delivered by Cupid so it can celebrate Valentine's day. The integers in the neighborhood
# indicate those needed hearts. Cupid starts at the position of the first house (index 0) and must jump by a given
# length. The jump commands will be in this format: "Jump {length}". Every time he jumps from one house to another,
# the needed hearts for the visited house are decreased by 2: If the needed hearts for a certain house become equal
# to 0, print on the console "Place {house_index} has Valentine's day." If Cupid jumps to a house where the needed
# hearts are already 0, print on the console "Place {house_index} already had Valentine's day." Keep in mind that
# Cupid can have a larger jump length than the size of the neighborhood, and if he does jump outside of it,
# he should start from the first house again (index 0) For example, we are given this neighborhood: 6@6@6. Cupid is
# at the start and jumps with a length of 2. He will end up at index 2 and decrease the needed hearts by 2: [6, 6,
# 4]. Next, he jumps again with a length of 2 and goes outside the neighborhood, so he goes back to the first house (
# index 0) and again decreases the needed hearts there: [4, 6, 4]. Input On the first line, you will receive a string
# with even integers separated by "@" â€“ the neighborhood and the number of hearts for each house. On the next lines,
# until "Love!" is received, you will be getting jump commands in this format: "Jump {length}". Output In the end,
# print Cupid's last position and whether his mission was successful or not: "Cupid's last position was {
# last_position_index}." If each house has had Valentine's day, print: "Mission was successful." If not,
# print the count of all houses that didn't celebrate Valentine's Day: "Cupid has failed {houseCount} places."
