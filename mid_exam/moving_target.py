# You are at the shooting gallery again, and you need a program that helps you keep track of moving targets. On the
# first line, you will receive a sequence of targets with their integer values, split by a single space. Then,
# you will start receiving commands for manipulating the targets until the "End" command. The commands are the
# following: "Shoot {index} {power}" Shoot the target at the index if it exists by reducing its value by the given
# power (integer value). Remove the target if it is shot. A target is considered shot when its value reaches 0. "Add {
# index} {value}" Insert a target with the received value at the received index if it exists. If not, print: "Invalid
# placement!" "Strike {index} {radius}" Remove the target at the given index and the ones before and after it
# depending on the radius. If any of the indices in the range is invalid, print: "Strike missed!" and skip this
# command. Example:  "Strike 2 2" {radius}	{radius}	{strikeIndex}	{radius}	{radius}
#
# "End"
# Print the sequence with targets in the following format and end the program:
# "{target1}|{target2}â€¦|{targetn}"
