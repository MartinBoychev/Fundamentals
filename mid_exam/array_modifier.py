# You are given an array with integers. Write a program to modify the elements after receiving the following
# commands: "swap {index1} {index2}" takes two elements and swap their places. "multiply {index1} {index2}" takes
# element at the 1st index and multiply it with the element at 2nd index. Save the product at the 1st index.
# "decrease" decreases all elements in the array with 1. Input On the first input line, you will be given the initial
# array values separated by a single space. On the next lines you will receive commands until you receive the command
# "end". The commands are as follow: "swap {index1} {index2}" "multiply {index1} {index2}" "decrease" Output The
# output should be printed on the console and consist of elements of the modified array â€“ separated by a comma and a
# single space ", ".
