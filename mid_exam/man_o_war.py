# Create a program that tracks the battle and either chooses a winner or prints a stalemate.
# On the first line, you will receive the status of the pirate ship,
# which is a string representing integer sections separated by ">".
# On the second line, you will receive the same type of status, but for the warship:
# "{section1}>{section2}>{section3}â€¦ {sectionn}"
# On the third line, you will receive the maximum health capacity a section of the ship can reach.
# The following lines represent commands until "Retire":
# "Fire {index} {damage}" - the pirate ship attacks the warship with the given damage at that section.
# Check if the index is valid and if not, skip the command. If the section breaks (health <= 0) the warship sinks,
# print the following and stop the program: "You won! The enemy ship has sunken."
# "Defend {startIndex} {endIndex} {damage}" - the warship attacks the pirate ship with the given damage at that range.
# Check if both indexes are valid and if not, skip the command. If the section breaks the pirate ship sinks,
# print the following and stop the program:
# "You lost! The pirate ship has sunken."
# "Repair {index} {health}" - the crew repairs a section of the pirate ship with the given health.
# Check if the index is valid and if not, skip the command.
# The health of the section cannot exceed the maximum health capacity.
# "Status" - prints the count of all sections of the pirate ship that need repair soon,
# which are all sections that are lower than 20% of the maximum health capacity. Print the following:
# "{count} sections need repair."
# In the end, if a stalemate occurs, print the status of both ships,
# which is the sum of their individual sections, in the following format:
# "Pirate ship status: {pirateShipSum}
# Warship status: {warshipSum}"
# Input
# On the 1st line, you are going to receive the status of the pirate ship (integers separated by '>')
# On the 2nd line, you are going to receive the status of the warship
# On the 3rd line, you will receive the maximum health a section of a ship can reach.
# On the following lines, until "Retire", you will be receiving commands.
# Output
# Print the output in the format described above.
