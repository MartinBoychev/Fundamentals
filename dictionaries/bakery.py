# Your first task at your new job is to create a table of the stock in a bakery, and you really don't want to fail on
# your first day at work. You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values). They
# will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value, and so on). Create a
# dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console.
